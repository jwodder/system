- Set up two possible modes of behavior: one for running against localhost,
  another for running against remote hosts
 - The remote mode should install this repository in /opt/jwodder (with the
   synchronize module?), while the local mode should require that it already be
   installed there

- ssl: If the domains in /opt/jwodder/etc/domains don't match those in the
  current cert(s) in /etc/letsencrypt, rerun /opt/jwodder/bin/letsencrypt.
- Add an option for installing dropbox "normally" rather than in a virtualenv?
- Other packages to consider automatically installing:
 - python-pip
 - python-dev
 - build-essential
 - apt-file
 - pwgen
 - python-virtualenv
 - python3-pip
 - python3-dev
 - jq [from source]
 - python-requests
 - Docker?
