  -executable

 - Set up Apache access monitoring
- Configure rsyslog
- Set up PostgreSQL
- Handle setting up /opt/jwodder/etc/domains
 - Set up DNS?
 - Use the presence of /opt/jwodder/etc/domains to determine whether or not to
   run the SSL role?
- Set up tmpban
 - Add personal cronjob "0 9 * * * untmpban --auto"
- ssl: Add flags to letsencrypt-auto for automatically accepting the user
  agreement
- Set up dailyreport

- Split the setup of Google 2FA into a separate role?
- When Docker is installed, add jwodder to the docker group
- devel: Install docker-compose
- Restrict the `always_set_home` option in `/etc/sudoers` to only apply to
  `pip` & `pip3`?

- Set up two possible modes of behavior: one for running against localhost,
  another for running against remote hosts
 - The remote mode should install this repository in /opt/jwodder (with the
   synchronize module?), while the local mode should require that it already be
   installed there
- Cron output should still be logged somehow/somewhere even when Postfix isn't
  installed
 - cf. <http://unix.stackexchange.com/q/82093/11006>
- Set up root's home directory
- Set up the admin user's home directory with home.git?
- Make the `/opt/jwodder` (and `/var/log/jwodder`?) path configurable

- ssl: If the domains in /opt/jwodder/etc/domains don't match those in the
  current cert(s) in /etc/letsencrypt, rerun /opt/jwodder/bin/letsencrypt.
- Add an option for installing dropbox "normally" rather than in a virtualenv?
- devel: Install jq, with an option for controlling whether to install from
  source or apt
- Other packages to consider automatically installing:
 - apt-file
 - pwgen
 - tree
