- Uncommented the `$SUITE-backports` lines in `/etc/apt/sources.list` (Doable
  with `apt-add-repository`?)
- Work around <https://bugs.mutt.org/trac/ticket/2953> by replacing `source
  /usr/lib/mutt/source-muttrc.d|` in /etc/Muttrc with `source
  /etc/Muttrc.d/$FILE` lines for each file in /etc/Muttrc.d
- Comment out/delete the line `/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages` from
  /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/easy-install.pth so that Python 2.7's
  `sys.path` will make sense.  (How did that line even get there in the first
  place???)
