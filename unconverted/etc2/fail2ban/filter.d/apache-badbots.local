# Update regex to match `vhost_combined` entries instead of `combined`:
failregex = ^[-\w.:]+ <HOST> -.*"(GET|POST|HEAD).*HTTP.*"(?:%(badbots)s|%(badbotscustom)s)"$
# (Note that "<HOST> <HOST>" won't work because that would result in the regex
# having two named capturing groups with the same name.)
