- Configured PAM rather than SSH to display the "Last login" message by setting
  "`PrintLastLog`" in /etc/ssh/sshd_config to `no` (and then restarting `ssh`)
  and adding the below lines to /etc/pam.d/sshd between the pam_env lines and
  the pam_selinux line:

    session [default=1] pam_lastlog.so nowtmp showfailed
    session optional    pam_lastlog.so silent noupdate showfailed

- Disabled `/etc/update-motd.d/{00-header,10-help-text}`
- Added `--exclude-sysinfo-plugins=LandscapeLink` to the `landscape-sysinfo`
  command in `/etc/update-motd.d/50-landscape-sysinfo`
- Added the line `\setenv LESS -iS` to `~postgres/.psqlrc` in order to make
  psql's pager always use `-S` (when sudo'ing in as `postgres`, at least)
- Enabled unattended-upgrades with `sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades`
    - Set the following values in `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades`:

            Unattended-Upgrade::InstallOnShutdown "false";
            Unattended-Upgrade::Mail "jwodder";
            Unattended-Upgrade::MailOnlyOnError "false";
            Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot "false";

- Uncommented the `trusty-backports` lines in `/etc/apt/sources.list`
